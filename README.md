## Commercial opportunities
<p>As soon as the application is ready, it can be offered to music stores (cfr BAX musicstore, Keymusic, etc ), 
they can run the application next to their webshop to build a larger customer base and to make targeted personalized advertising to music teachers and students. 
If there is not enough interest from the retail instruments to support the platform, personalized advertising can also be switched to via the web application itself. (eg offer advertisements for guitars on the search page when the parameters “guitar/classical” and “beginner” are given.</p>
